					<h1>Manhunt continues</h1>

				</header>

					<p>According to Sweat, officials said, this is how the plan was supposed to play out:</p>

					<p>Sweat and Matt would come out of a manhole and meet Mitchell, who would drive them away. The convicted murderers would then kill Mitchell's husband Lyle before fleeing to Mexico.</p>

					<p>But Mitchell never showed up, forcing the fugitives to improvise on the run for more than three weeks. The two split up along the way, apparently because Sweat thought his older, less athletic partner was slowing him down, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.</p>

					<p>Police caught up with and killed Matt last Friday. Two days later, an officer shot and wounded Sweat less than 2 miles from the Canadian border.</p>
